Understanding the Dining Philosophers' Problem
The Dining Philosophers Problem is a classic concurrency problem where philosophers sit at a round table with a rice bowl in the center. Each philosopher needs two chopsticks to eat. The problem arises when all philosophers pick up their left chopstick simultaneously, causing a deadlock.
Solution Approach: Using a Waiter as a Mutex
We can solve this problem by introducing a waiter as a mutex. Only one philosopher can be served by the waiter at a time. When a philosopher wants to eat, they must first request the waiter's attention. If the waiter is available, they are granted permission to pick up the chopsticks and eat. Once finished, they return the chopsticks and release the waiter.

Explanation:
Philosopher Class:
Each philosopher is represented as a thread.
They acquire the waiter's semaphore before picking up chopsticks.
After eating, they release the chopsticks and the waiter.
Main Execution:
We create eight chopsticks (semaphores) and a waiter semaphore.
We create eight philosopher threads and start them.
Key Points:
The waiter semaphore ensures that only one philosopher can be served at a time, preventing deadlocks.
Using semaphores for chopsticks ensures that only one philosopher can hold a chopstick at a time.
The time.sleep() functions simulate thinking and eating time, allowing for fair resource allocation.
